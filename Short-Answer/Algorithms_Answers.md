#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)  I think the runtime would be O(n) My reason would be that the total amount operations would be determined by N. So for instance if 
n = 6 then the number operations would be 6 and will stay true. As long as N is assigned to a number. A better term that I can understand would be linear.



b) I suppose the runtime would O(log n) or logarthimic. first reason would be that it is a nested loop. Meaning the j will double everytime  you loop through it multiplying it by 2 each pass.  


c) The runtime would be linear again or O(n) because the amount of operations are again determined by n. 

## Exercise II

The goal would to minimize the amount of the egg cracking on the floors.
I guess since you are looping the floors once then it would O(n). Meaning it would be linear. We would need to loop through the floors n times to find 'f' floor the optimal floor. The more floors the more operations.
